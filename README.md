## Hello, there!

### Pleased to meet you.


I'm Sthabile (Thabs), an astronomer and lecturer at the Physics department of the University of Johannesburg in South Africa. 

For my research work in Astrophysics, I make use of both observations and modelling to study galaxies at high-redshift. My research involves: 

- Investigations of the role of galaxy group environment and radio AGN jet-power
- Kinematic studies of the circumgalactic medium 
- Star-formation and stellar masses of radio-selected galaxies at z > 2
- Lyman-alpha radiative transfer modelling of diffuse ionised gas haloes

A comprehensive list of my current work is available on [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9821-4987). 

Aside from Astrophysics, I have spent some time working on a few exploratory data science and machine-learning projects all of which are made public via [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/sthabile). 

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/sthabile_kolwa) as well where I stay a few things from time to time. I try to make time to write articles on [Medium](https://sthabile.medium.com/) where the topics of discussion are generally coding and astronomy. 

Find me [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sthabile-kolwa/) if you'd like to establish a professional connection with me. 


Otherwise...

### Happy coding!
