## Hello, there!

### Nice to meet you.

### Sthabile Kolwa, here!


Some call me Thabs for short.

I'm an early-career Astronomer and lecturer at the University of Johannesburg. 

In my research, I specialise in observational Astrophysics with a specific interest in rather exotic galaxies known to emit significant amounts of radio emission. These objects are known as [radio galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_galaxy) and I have spent a considerable amount of time trying to find out more about the kinematics and chemical composition of the gas surrounding them using model-fitting techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo evaluation and non-linear least squares fitting. This is all done for the sake of learning more about how radio galaxies evolve. 

In my research, I extracted ground-based and space-based telescope data and analysed it using modules that I wrote primarily in **Python**. Since, I also have a keen interest in data science, I spend some of my time carrying out exploratory data analysis and predictive modelling. 

All in all, in my repos you will find both formal work as well as some fun pet projects I like to execute in order to keep my skills up and continually improving. Some of the Jupyter Notebooks I post here may be work that I featured on my [Kaggle profile](http://kaggle.com/sthabile). 

I also maintain a presence on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/sthabile_kolwa) where I try hard to keep my controversy downto a minimum. 

You can also find me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sthabs.k) where I gravitate to articles on tech, data science and cybersecurity. 

For a summary of my professional profile, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sthabile-kolwa/) is the one!

For direct contact, hit me up at: sthabile.kolwa@gmail.com 
I am very keen to partake in Kaggle competitions and open source projects. 


### Happy coding!
